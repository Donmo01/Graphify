FileZilla-server.exe is a component of the XAMPP software package, published by Apache Friends, and is primarily used as a server application for transferring files over the Internet using the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP Secure) protocols. The version 0.9.41.0 of this executable is generally regarded as safe when downloaded from the official XAMPP website, as it is part of a well-known suite for web development that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. However, like any executable file, it can potentially be flagged by antivirus software if it is modified or if it is found in an untrusted context, leading some users to mistakenly believe it is malware. Users may occasionally encounter errors related to configuration, connectivity, or permissions when running FileZilla Server, but these are typically resolvable through adjustments in settings or firewall permissions. As always, it is advisable to ensure that software is downloaded from reputable sources and to keep antivirus definitions up to date to avoid any risks associated with malicious software.
